## Problem Statement 
To design and create a product (website) where users/consumers/retailers can easily schedule their recyclable waste pickup according to their convenience with standardized pricing across cities 

## Objectives


* To bridge the gap between various stakeholders of the Recyclable e-waste ecosystem. 
* Facilitate a dynamic website for users with a personalized experience for each one.
* Help the user to schedule pickup according to their convenience.


## General Flow

In the existing system, the journey of a user who wants to sell his recyclable e-waste starts with uncertainty and ends with frustration and dissatisfaction.

Our primary purpose remains to simplify and enhance user experience, consistent pricing, efficient recyclable waste logistics, and transparency at every level.
The solution to the existing flawed system is a recyclable waste management website.

The user comes to our website through the internet. When he enters the website, he is asked to log in / sign up. After which he could schedule a pickup from his home by
entering the date and time according to his convenience.

As soon as we receive a request, we take note of the date and timing that the user has entered. We send our representative to the users’ house at the requested date and time. To ensure transparency we use a digital weighing machine and then and there itself reimburse the predecided amount to the user.

On the spot, the waste is segregated by our well-informed and trained representative into different commodities. Then we directly contact the recycling plants nearest to the locality of the user and drop off the recyclable waste to the recycling plant at minimum commission.
